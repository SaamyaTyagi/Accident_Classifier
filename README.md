# Industrial Accident Severity Classification

This project builds a machine learning model to classify the severity of industrial accidents in the Mining and Metals sector, aiming to improve safety response and risk mitigation.

---

## Objective

Predict accident severity from incident descriptions and structured metadata to support faster decision-making and accident prevention.

---

## Dataset

- 425 industrial accident records (Jan 2016 â€“ Sep 2017)  
- Collected from 12 plants across 3 countries  
- Includes: text descriptions, location, gender, and severity labels

---

## Methodology

- Preprocessed text using NLP techniques (lemmatization, stopword removal, TF-IDF)
- Trained over 10 ML/DL models including Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, and LSTM
- Applied cross-validation and feature engineering for improved results

---

## Results

- Achieved up to **85% F1-score** on severity classification  
- Identified key patterns in risk distribution across gender and locations  
- Model offers actionable insights for workplace safety systems
